# The Biscuit Machine
Online preview: https://the-biscuit-machine.netlify.app

The Machine operates in the following way:
- When switched on, the machine waits for the oven to warm up before starting the conveyor belt.
- The Extruder drops dough on the conveyor which gets moved and stamped.
- The stamped biscuit is moved to the oven where it gets baked and then moved to the container.
- If the operator selects “Pause", all movement is stopped immediately but the oven is kept heated.
- When “Off” is selected, the machine gets shut down leaving nothing on the conveyor belt.
